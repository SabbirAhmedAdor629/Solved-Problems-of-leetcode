Intution behind the solution :

first sort the array 
then double for loop , i<arr2.length, j<arr1.length
adding elements from the arr1 to the output array maintining the order of arr2
single for lop to add remaining elements which left at the arr1


class Solution {
    public int[] relativeSortArray(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        Arrays.sort(arr1);
        int[] ans = new int[arr1.length];
        int k = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr2.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < arr1.length; j++) {
                if (arr2[i] == arr1[j]){
                    ans[k++] = arr1[j];
                    arr1[j] = -1;
                }
            }
        }
        for (int i : arr1){
            if (i != -1) ans[k++] = i;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}




intituion was similar so i take the code from this link : 
https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-sort-array/discuss/2327263/Java-Solution-or-2ms-Faster
to save time of coding
