//Since the range of int in java is -2147483648 to 2147483647 and the two numbers are outside and very close to this range(2147483647 and 2147395600), 
//when the (mid*mid) exceeds this limit it gets rolled back to negative side and the loop continues or gives a wrong output.
//A simple solution would be mid==x/mid
